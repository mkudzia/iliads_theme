# iliads_theme
This repository should hopefully make it easier for ILiADS folks to work on the theme for the website.

## Assumptions re: branch structure
- Master should always be safe for production
- There's a branch for each year that contains site-specific colors, etc.
- Developers are welcome to make individual branches for dev work and experimentation
- When changes are ready to go live, they should first be merged into the site- and year-specific branch, then into master
- If we want, the site can be reverted back to "plain" master or to a "plain" branch in between the end of a conference and the beginning of the next conference cycle
- Master is the default branch in the repo
